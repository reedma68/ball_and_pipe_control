# Ball and Pipe Control System (PID Kappa Tau Tuning Method & Ziegler-Nichols)
MATLAB codes to open serial communication with a ball and pipe system. The system is made of a vertical cylinder with a ping pong ball controlled by a fan on the bottom and height measured by a time of flight sensor on top. The objective is to balance the ball at a target altitude. The method being used to balance the ball is the Kappa Tau tuning method. 

# Kappa Tau Overview
Kappa Tau tuning is a method of tuning a PID control system for desired optimal system output. It is an evolution of the Ziegler-Nichols method.
